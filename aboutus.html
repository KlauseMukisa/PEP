    <h1>What is PEP?</h1>
    <P>HIV PEP, or post exposure prophylaxis, is a short course of HIV medicine to prevent the virus from taking hold in your body.</P>

    <p>PEP should be used only in emergency situations. It is not meant for regular use by people who may be exposed to HIV frequently</p>
    <h1>How do you know if you need PEP?</h1>
    <P>PEP may be right for you if you are HIV negative or dont know your HIV status, and you think you may have been exposed to HIV in the last 72 hours:</P>

                 <p>- During sex(for example, you had a condom break wuth a partner of unknown HIV status or a partner with HIV who virally supressed)</p>
                 <p>- Through shared needles,syringes, or other equipments used to inject drugs(for example cookers)</p>
                 <p>-Through sexual assault</p>
                 <p>-Through a possible workplace exposure, such as from needlestick injury. Workplace HIV transmissions are extremely very rare</p>

    <h1>Where can you get PEP?</h1>      
    <P>If you think you were recently exposed to HIV, contact a health care provider or go to an emrgency room or urgent care clinic right away</P> 

    <p>Your health care provider, an urgent care provider or em/ergency room doctor will evaluate you, help you decide whether PEP is right for you, and with you to determine which medicines to take for PEP. In some cities, pharmacists can also prescribe PEP for example Kampala at First Pharmacy located wandegeya</p> 

    <h1>How long do you need to take PEP?</h1>

    <P>If you have prescribed PEP, you will need to take the HIV medicines every day for 28 days.It si important to take all the doses as prescribed to give PEP the best chance of working.</P>

    <p>You will also need to return to your healthcare providerat certain times while taking PEP and after you finish taking it for follow-up HIV testing at 4 to 6 weeksand at 3 months and for other lab tests.</p>
    <h1>How well does PEP work?</h1>
    <p>PEP is effective in preventing HIV when taken correctly, but its not 100% effective. The sooner you after possible HIV exposure, the better.</p>
    <p>While taking PEP, it is important to use other HIV prevention methods such as using condoms the right way.every time you have sex and using only new, sterile needles and works when injecting drugs</p>

    <h1>Can you take PEP when you are pregnant or breastfeeding?</h1>
    <p>Yes. PEP is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, consult with a health care provider about PEP and which PEP regimen is right for you</p>
    <h1>Can you take PEP everytime you have a potential exposure to HIV?</h1>
    <P>No. PEP should be used only in emergency situations. It is not intended to replace regular use of other HIV prevention methods. If you feel that you might be exposed to HIV frequently, talk to your health care professional about PrEP(Pre-exposure prophylaxis)</P>
